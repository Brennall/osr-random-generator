Change Log
==========


v0.3 - 2014-03-02
-----------------

* Added a way to import/save user's own tables. Right now you it either accepts a full JSON object or a simple one entry per line text format.
* Added code documentation with JSDoc3 commenting.
* Cleaned up RandomTable class and AppRandomizer functioning to be, hopefully, simpler and more consistent.
* Moved more of the pre-RandomTable stuff into the RandomTable format/class (like NPC personalities, appearance, goals, and occupations).
* More wilderness encounter tables (mostly in-process).
* Added the "list table" function for complex tables. It should show all the tables and subtables now in a semi-usable format. (Depending on the weight values, it might not convert to real dice rolls.)


v0.2 - 2014-02-24
-----------------

* Lots of stuff, but since no one really saw v0.1, I'm not going to list it all here.
