The type of creature to be snared must be known and stated during the casting.</p><p>The spell requires the caster to have already created the restraining ward.

They can resist the summons with a Save, modified if the caster uses their <em>True Name</em>.</p><p>If the Save succeeds, the creature ignores the opening, and the spell fails. If it succeeds by 6 or more, they may learn of the identity of the would-be trapper, and later exact retribution. If the Save fails, the creature steps into the opening and is drawn into the <em class=\"spellname\">Pentacle</em>.</p><p>A <em class=\"spellname\">Great Pentacle</em> may also fail at the moment of arrival of its occupant; the chance is as follows:</p><ul><li>A hand-drawn <em class=\"spellname\">Pentacle</em> using mundane chalk, paint or the like takes 10 minutes to create, and has a base chance of failure of 20%. If it is drawn over a longer period of time, using specially prepared pigments, the chance of breaking free is reduced by 1% for every extra hour. This can bring the base chance to 5%; the minimum for a hand-drawn ward. The rare and expensive pigments cost 10gp per extra hour spent drawing.</li><li>An inlaid or carved design will require one week of work by the caster and cost 100gp, with a base chance of failure of 10%. It can be improved by using inlays of onyx and True Lead, and oils of angelica and garlic. Each 1% improvement will cost an additional 50gp and require an additional week of work. This can bring the base chance of failure to 0.</li></ul><p>A <em class=\"spellname\">Pentacle</em> that fails has no power over its intended victim.</p><p>A being caught in a <em class=\"spellname\">Great Pentacle</em> cannot pass through its lines, nor use magic or other supernatural abilities on anything outside it. It will be able to throw missiles across the ward, so by tradition the inside of the <em class=\"spellname\">Pentacle</em> is kept bare of objects.</p><p>Only the summoner can enter the <em class=\"spellname\">Pentacle</em> without breaking it. Any other interruption of the ward will render it useless - this includes creatures entering the bounded regions, a straw laid across the lines, or an object thrown into the area from outside.</p><p>Once safely trapped, the caster can offer bribes, use promises, or make threats in order to exact one service from the captive creature. It will usually resist such a service, with a score that begins as being equal to its Wisdom +3. This score drops by 1 for each month that the captive remains within the <em class=\"spellname\">Pentacle</em>.</p><p>The DM will assign a value to what the wizard has said to the trapped creature, rating it from 0 to 5 (with 5 being the most persuasive). This rating is then subtracted from the resistance score of the creature. If the creature rolls a successful 2d10 check against this score, it refuses the service. New offers can be made, or the old ones offered again, once each month.</p><p>However, a creature will never agree to an impossible or completely unreasonable demand.</p><p>This can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, until the duration expires, or until the caster decides to free it.</p><p>Once a single service is completed, the creature only needs to inform the caster to be instantly returned whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge.</p><p>If a captive is freed by the caster without completing a service, it will immediately be able to attack, flee or perform any action it wishes.</p><p>Instead of bargaining with the captive, the caster can choose to use <em class=\"spell\">The Spell Of Binding</em> to doubly imprison it. Breaking the <em class=\"spellname\">Binding</em> does not necessarily free the subject from the <em class=\"spellname\">Great Pentacle</em>; the combined results will depend on the method of <em class=\"spellname\">Binding</em> used.</p>"

Creatures, or items held by a creature, can resist, but the <em>Aerial Servant</em> <em>Surprises</em> at -3, unless the victim has detected it in some manner. Each round of combat, the <em>Aerial Servant</em> makes a Grappling attack. When a hit is scored, the <em>Servant</em> has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for.</p><p>The <em>Aerial Servant</em> will then fly back to its master with the target. A grabbed creature can try to struggle free, rolling Str vs. the <em>Servant</em>'s Str of 20. The attempt can be made once per round, but at a -1 penalty to the victim's Str each round after the first. If the target does break free, they will drop out of the Servant's grasp, but it will immediately try to grab them again.</p><p>Once the quarry has been dropped at the feet of the caster (even if he no longer lives), the <em>Servant</em> will leave whence it came.</p>"
